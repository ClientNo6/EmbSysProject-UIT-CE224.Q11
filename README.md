This project is about using ESP32D-WROOM to implement an embedded system. This system includes motor (to run conveyor), servo (to distribute products), rgb-color sensor (to classify products depending on their colors) and obstacle avoidance sensor (to count products after distributing).
To finish this project we have to learn about GPIOs, I2C, PWM, Interrupt and also read datasheets of hardwares, ESP32 (on Espressif),...etc.</br>
This repo includes project folder that has:</br>
main.c file</br>
sensors handler libraries</br>
servo&motor controller libraries</br>
...</br>
